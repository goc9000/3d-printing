Dual Battery Box
================

Motivation
----------

I need to keep both AA and AAA size batteries for various projects, and at least two 4-battery sets of each. Up until now, I used to keep them in two separate plastic boxes in a drawer, however this has the disadvantage of using more space than necessary and allowing the batteries to roll around inside the boxes whenever the drawer is moved.

I thus need a box that can:

- Store both AA and AAA batteries (8 of each)
- Keep each battery in a secure position so they can't move around and touch each other
- Use as little space as possible and achieve a tradeoff between horizontal vs vertical used space


Construction
------------

The basic shape of the box consists of a block of solid matter out of which we cut out cylindrical slots corresponding to each battery. Horizontally, the slots are arranged in two rows for the AA batteries followed by two rows for the AAA batteries, as I find this balances the use of horizontal space in both directions (X and Y).

Around this basic shape, internally called the *core*, we add top, bottom and side walls to form a usable box. Finally, this watertight shape is split along a horizontal plane so as to form a lid and a base that can be separated so as to open the box.


First Print Notes
-----------------

- First printed Nov 2016
- Printed using PET
- Lid comes off easily, there is moderate to low friction between it and the base. I'd have liked a bit more friction, should try 0.08mm.
- The horizontal spacing for the batteries (1mm) is too much. The batteries move more than I'd like and cause difficulty when putting the top back on. Should try 0.4mm or lower.
- The PET is a disappointment as far as translucency goes. Perhaps it would work better after vapor polishing?
